# Lab 1: scRNA-seq Data Preprocessing

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand barcode structure in scRNA-seq data
- Learn about UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) extraction
- Perform quality control on raw sequencing reads
- Process and prepare data for downstream analysis

## Background

Single-cell RNA-seq generates millions of reads per cell. Understanding the structure of sequencing reads—including cell barcodes and UMIs—is essential for proper preprocessing.

## Sections

1. **Understanding Barcodes**: Learn about 10x Genomics barcode structure
2. **UMI Extraction**: Extract and process UMI tags from reads
3. **Quality Control**: Assess read quality and filtering
4. **Data Formatting**: Prepare data for analysis in Scanpy
