    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Cell Overview\n",
    "Single Cell technologies like 10X Genomics and BD Rhapsody allow you to partition individual cells into wells or droplets and sequence the mRNA reads of the individual cells. Because of this, the sequencing output is often referred to as an Expression Library. The technology relies on the capture of the mRNA poly-A tail using a poly dT sequence that is attached to a bead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://help.geneiousbiologics.com/hc/article_attachments/8234399911316\" alt=\"beads\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen above, there are two other features found on the sequence used to capture mRNAs: a Barcode and a UMI. These are crucial to understanding your sequence library and evaluating the quality of your reads. In general, Single Cell technologies generate paired-end reads that have a Barcode followed by a UMI at either the 3' or 5' end of the parent sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Barcodes?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad types of Barcodes: Feature Barcodes and Cell Barcodes. Both are short nucleotide tags (~16 bp) that are used to \"label\" sequences. These labels are used to sort sequences that have originated from a single cell source, or to denote some other feature of the cell like the presence of a particular cell surface protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell Barcode:** Sequences with the same cell barcode can be grouped together as coming from the same cell source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Barcode:** Used as an additional tag to indicate the presence of a cell surface protein. As seen below, the Feature Barcode is concatenated to an antibody against the cell surface target. The Feature Barcode can then be assigned to a Cell Barcode via capture to a bead containing the Cell Barcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://help.geneiousbiologics.com/hc/article_attachments/8403663699476\" alt=\"feature barcode\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are UMIs?\n",
    "UMIs (Unique Molecular Identifiers) are used for quality control purposes and are also used in other non-Single Cell sequencing kits. Like Barcodes, UMIs are short nucleotide sequences. However, unlike Barcodes the sequences are random with a very low likelihood of a duplicate UMI within a single bead; therefore each mRNA read is assigned a unique UMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the starting material is very low and of poor quality, PCR amplification is needed to generate enough material for High Throughput Sequencing technologies like Illumina. During PCR amplification, base incorporation errors and biased amplification can occur. These stochastic effects in the first rounds of PCR can propagate through to the final sequenced library. UMIs are used to screen out these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure shows how UMIs can be used to determine the starting mRNA content, as each UMI represents one initial mRNA read.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://help.geneiousbiologics.com/hc/article_attachments/12808324089236\" alt=\"UMI quantification\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Read Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The below image provides an overview of a generic initial amplification process. Upon reaching the 5’ end of the RNA template during first-strand synthesis, the reverse transcriptase enzyme used in the reaction appends additional non-template nucleotides to the sequence, mostly deoxycytidine residues. This non-template sequence is used as a binding site for a template switching oligonucleotide (TSO). The TSO causes the transcriptase enzyme to switch from transcribing the RNA template sequence to transcribing the TSO sequence, generating the complementary cDNA strand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://help.geneiousbiologics.com/hc/article_attachments/8404901907988\" alt=\"final read format\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-cell RNA-seq workflows use two short sequences to turn sequencing reads into accurate per-cell molecule counts: a cell barcode (which labels the droplet or well a read came from) and a UMI (unique molecular identifier) that tags individual RNA molecules before amplification. Together they let pipelines group reads by cell and collapse PCR duplicates so counts reflect input molecules rather than amplification artifacts.\n",

    "### tl;dr\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Barcode placement and format depend on the technology** (for example, many droplet-based methods place cell barcodes and UMIs at the start of Read 1 or in a dedicated index read). Sequencing strategies separate the short barcode/UMI reads from the longer cDNA read.\n",

    "+ **Cell barcodes may be drawn from a predefined set - _whitelist_ for many platforms** this lets tools correct sequencing errors by matching to the nearest valid barcode. Barcode lengths are protocol-specific (10x commonly uses a 16 bp cell barcode).\n",
    "UMIs are short random sequences (10–12 bp is common) attached to molecules before amplification; they allow deduplication of PCR duplicates by collapsing reads that share the same UMI and map to the same gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues**\n",
